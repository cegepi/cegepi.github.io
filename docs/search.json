    "text": "Hello! My name is Charley Gaber. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Pharmacy Systems, Outcomes & and Policy (PSOP) in the College of Pharmacy at the University of Illinois-Chicago. My applied research focuses on characterizing the use, effectiveness, and safety of cancer-directed therapies in older adults diagnosed with advanced malignancies of the esophagus, pancreas, and prostate. I seek to generate robust evidence from observational data by harnessing modern causal inference study design and analysis strategies, such as the target-trial emulation approach. Methodologically, I have explored how to increase the utility of statistical estimators for recurrent events when working with non-experimental data."
