    "text": "My name is Charley Gaber. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Pharmacy Systems, Outcomes, and Policy (PSOP) and a member of the Center for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomic Research (CPR). My applied research focuses on the use and effectiveness of cancer-directed therapies in older adults diagnosed with poor prognosis malignancies. I seek to generate robust evidence from observational data by harnessing modern causal inference study design and analysis strategies, such as the target-trial emulation approach. Methodologically, I have explored how to increase the utility of statistical estimators for recurrent events when working with non-experimental data. Future work will examine heterogenous treatment effects of cancer treatments using predictive modeling. I am an active member of the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology (ISPE), Society of Epidemiologic Research (SER), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)."
